# Physics-Constrained Neural Network as a multi-material Riemann Solver (PCNN-RS)
#####    Contained within this repository is the codebase for PCNN-RS. Its purpose is to generate the results presented in the article titled "Unsupervised neural-network solvers for multi-material Riemann problems".
 
# Environmental dependence
#####    The "torch" library in Anaconda is required for this project.
